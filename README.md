## The challenge

In this challenge, you should be able to write a React app using whatever tools you want.

If you need to get started faster you can use Create react app (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


What you are building

You will be building a simple React app to search for Github users and display their information.


You will be using the Github API.


It will consist of two pages:

The search page - It needs to have at least one input to type the Github username you want to search for and a button that will trigger the search.

The user page - A page to display the user information and repositories. It will need a button to go back to the Search page.

User information to display:

Profile picture

Name

Total number of repositories

List of repositories with pagination (repository name and description)


You’re free to implement your own design or you can mimic/get ideas from the existing one in Github.


What we will look at

How do you work with HTML, CSS, JS, and React

How you structure your codebase and how well it reads

How well it works


What you can’t use

A UI library with stylized components/classes ready to use like Bootstrap, Material UI, Tailwind, ChakraUI, etc. You can still use libraries like styled-components or use SASS to create your styles; we just want to see how you'll structure your CSS code to achieve something (however simple).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
To install all dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
